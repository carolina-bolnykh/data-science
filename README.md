**Classification Summary & Results:**
Through feature engineering, feature selection, data analysis, and classification trees, we have analyzed how different factors play a role in classifying IMDB scores of movies and tv-shows. My best performing model indicates that the 3 most informative features in reducing impurity for IMDB classification of tv-shows are runtime, release year, and actor median, where the first/most informative feature is runtime. The identifying features for movies are genres, actor median, and runtime, where the first/most informative feature is genre. We have proven our hypothesis that since shows and movies are different in nature, they will have different factors that influence their IMDB score (even though they come from the same dataset with the same features).
